# Pharmacy-Sales-Dashboard
This Excel-based interactive dashboard provides an overview of a pharmacy company's sales performance segmented by region, top sales representatives, and time period. The dashboard includes filters to enhance data exploration, allowing users to make data-driven decisions.
Features

    Sales by Representative (Top 10):
        A bar chart visualizes the top 10 sales representatives by total sales amount, with values displayed within each bar for easy reference.

    Sales by Time Period:
        A line chart shows total sales over time, segmented by Year, Quarter, and Month, making it easy to identify sales trends and seasonal patterns.

    Country Slicer:
        This filter allows users to view data specific to selected regions. When a region is chosen, the charts update automatically to reflect sales for that region.

    Order Date Timeline:
        A timeline filter based on order dates allows users to narrow down the data by specific time periods, controlling the date range displayed in both charts.

How to Use

    Choose a Region: Use the Country Slicer to filter sales data by specific regions.
    Adjust Timeframe: Use the Order Date Timeline to focus on a particular time range, such as specific years or quarters.
    Analyze Results: Review the bar chart to identify top-performing sales reps and the line chart to observe trends in sales over time.

Requirements
